# Chess Board Project - Java

## Project Overview

The Chess Board Project is a Java-based application that simulates a chessboard and allows for the movement of chess pieces. This project implements the basic mechanics of chess, with a focus on handling chess piece movements, validations, and capturing logic. The project provides a functional foundation for building a complete chess game, without relying on a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Chess Piece Movement**: Basic chess piece movement implemented for different types of pieces (King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, and Pawn).
- **Piece Validations**: Validity checks for legal piece movements according to chess rules (including special moves like castling and en passant).
- **Piece Capture**: The ability to capture pieces when moved to an occupied square by an opposing piece.
- **Text-Based Interface**: The chessboard is represented through a text-based console interface, allowing users to interact by inputting coordinates for piece movements.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven/Gradle (optional, depending on the setup)
